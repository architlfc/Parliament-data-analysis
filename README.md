2. Identify year wise percentage of male and female candidates?
![](assignment_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

3. Create a new column by binning the Runs column using the following ranges and plot the frequency count of ranges
0-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-100, 100+


```r
odi<-read.csv("C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Data visualisation/odi-batting.csv")

odi$Runs_Range<-cut(odi$Runs,breaks=c(-1,25,50,75,100,Inf),labels = c("0-25", "26-50", "51-75", "76-100","100+"))

plot(as.factor(odi$Runs_Range))
```

4. Consider the top ten players by total runs and compute and visualize the number of centuries across years (use facet_grid or facet_wrap)
